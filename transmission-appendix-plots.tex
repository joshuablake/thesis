        Goodness-of-fit to prevalence data by region and age for selected regions (see \cref{SEIR:fig:prev} for others).
        The central ribbon and line show the posterior median and 95\% CrI estimate for the proportion of the relevant stratum RT-PCR positive on each day.
        The lighter outer ribbon is the 95\% posterior predictive interval for the proportion of test results that are positive each week.
        The dots show the observed prevalence in CIS, aggregated by week.
        For a well-calibrated model, 95\% of the dots would be within the outer ribbon.
