  abstract = {Background Repeated measurements of cross-sectional prevalence of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) positivity or seropositivity provide rich insight into the dynamics of an infection. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. Methods We used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. Results We produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. Conclusions Beyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.},

For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4–7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n\,=\,309 cases) and estimated that 19\% (95\% confidence interval, 15–24\%) of cases seeded 80\% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P\,=\,0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P\,=\,0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95\% CI, 1.9–107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.},

Measuring decline is not straightforward, since one must consider the choice of scale to measure cognitive ability, possible floor and ceiling effects, between-patient variability, and the unobserved age of onset. The authors demonstrate how to account for the above features by modeling decline in scores on the Mini-Mental State Exam in two different data sets. To this end, they use hierarchical Bayesian models with change points, for which posterior distributions are calculated using the Gibbs sampler. They make comparisons between several such models using both prior and posterior Bayes factors, and compare the results from the models suggested by these two model selection criteria.},

Here we investigate whether smoothed non-parametric back-projection based on this simplifying assumption gives sensible back-projections and appropriate measures of precision for these reconstructed HIV incidence curves. Simple models for HIV transmission are shown to have much greater variation than the corresponding non-homogeneous Poisson process arising from the independence assumption. Nevertheless, bearing in mind that the objective is to reconstruct the HIV epidemic curve for the current epidemic, it is argued that such back-projection does give sensible HIV curves. This conclusion is supported by a simulation study, which also finds that confidence intervals for the HIV incidences are wider for transmission data than those determined from independent Poisson data.},

We embed an age-structured model into a Bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns and health-seeking behavior throughout the epidemic, uncovering two similar infection waves, despite large differences in the reported levels of disease. We show how this approach, which allows for real-time learning about model parameters as the epidemic progresses, is also able to provide a sequence of nested projections that are capable of accurately reflecting the epidemic evolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Real-time modelling is an essential component of the public health response to an outbreak of pandemic influenza in the UK. A model for epidemic reconstruction based on realistic epidemic surveillance data has been developed, but this model needs enhancing to provide spatially disaggregated epidemic estimates while ensuring that real-time implementation is feasible. OBJECTIVES To advance state-of-the-art real-time pandemic modelling by (1) developing an existing epidemic model to capture spatial variation in transmission, (2) devising efficient computational algorithms for the provision of timely statistical analysis and (3) incorporating the above into freely available software. METHODS Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was used to derive Bayesian statistical inference using 2009 pandemic data from two candidate modelling approaches: (1) a parallel-region (PR) approach, splitting the pandemic into non-interacting epidemics occurring in spatially disjoint regions; and (2) a meta-region (MR) approach, treating the country as a single meta-population with long-range contact rates informed by census data on commuting. Model discrimination is performed through posterior mean deviance statistics alongside more practical considerations. In a real-time context, the use of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms to carry out real-time analyses is investigated as an alternative to MCMC using simulated data designed to sternly test both algorithms. SMC-derived analyses are compared with 'gold-standard' MCMC-derived inferences in terms of estimation quality and computational burden. RESULTS The PR approach provides a better and more timely fit to the epidemic data. Estimates of pandemic quantities of interest are consistent across approaches and, in the PR approach, across regions (e.g. R0 is consistently estimated to be 1.76-1.80, dropping by 43-50\% during an over-summer school holiday). A SMC approach was developed, which required some tailoring to tackle a sudden 'shock' in the data resulting from a pandemic intervention. This semi-automated SMC algorithm outperforms MCMC, in terms of both precision of estimates and their timely provision. Software implementing all findings has been developed and installed within Public Health England (PHE), with key staff trained in its use. LIMITATIONS The PR model lacks the predictive power to forecast the spread of infection in the early stages of a pandemic, whereas the MR model may be limited by its dependence on commuting data to describe transmission routes. As demand for resources increases in a severe pandemic, data from general practices and on hospitalisations may become unreliable or biased. The SMC algorithm developed is semi-automated; therefore, some statistical literacy is required to achieve optimal performance. CONCLUSIONS Following the objectives, this study found that timely, spatially disaggregate, real-time pandemic inference is feasible, and a system that assumes data as per pandemic preparedness plans has been developed for rapid implementation. FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS Modelling studies investigating the impact of pandemic interventions (e.g. vaccination and school closure); the utility of alternative data sources (e.g. internet searches) to augment traditional surveillance; and the correct handling of test sensitivity and specificity in serological data, propagating this uncertainty into the real-time modelling.

  abstract = {In this article, the author reviews current approaches and methods for measuring the scope of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic and their strengths and weaknesses. In recent years, various public health agencies have revised statistical estimates of the scope of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The author considers the reasons underlying these revisions. New sources of data for estimating HIV prevalence have become available, such as nationally representative probability-based surveys. New technologies such as biomarkers that indicate when persons became infected are now used to determine HIV incidence rates. The author summarizes the main sources of errors and problems with these and other approaches and discusses opportunities for improving their reliability. Changing methods and data sources present new challenges, because incidence and prevalence estimates produced at different points in time are not directly comparable with each other, which complicates assessment of time trends. The methodological changes help explain the changes in global statistics. As methods and data sources continue to improve, the development of statistical tools for better assessing the extent to which changes in HIV/AIDS statistics can be attributed to changes in methodology versus real changes in the underlying epidemic is an important challenge.},

  abstract = {A methodology is proposed for obtaining short-term projections of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic by projecting the number of cases from those already infected with the AIDS virus. This is a lower bound on the size of the AIDS epidemic, because even if future infections could be prevented, one could still anticipate this number of cases. The methodology is novel in that no assumptions are required about either the number of infected individuals in the population or the probability of an infected individual eventually developing AIDS. The methodology presupposes knowledge of the incubation distribution, however, among those destined to develop AIDS. Although the method does not account for new infections, it may produce accurate short-term projections because of the relatively long incubation period from infection to clinically diagnosed AIDS. The estimation procedure "back-calculates" from AIDS incidence data to numbers previously infected. The number of cases diagnosed in each calendar period has a multinomial distribution with cell probabilities that can be expressed as a convolution of the density of infection times and the incubation distribution. The problem is shown to reduce to estimating the size of a multinomial population. A simple EM algorithm is developed for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates when the density of infection times is parameterized as a step function. The methodology is applied to AIDS incidence data in the United States, to obtain short-term projections and an estimate of the minimum size of the epidemic by assuming no new infections in 1987 and after. The sensitivity of the projections to the assumed incubation distribution is investigated. It was found that short-term projections are not nearly as sensitive to the assumed incubation distribution as long-term projections. Although some information on the incubation distribution has been reported from an analysis of transfusion-associated AIDS cases, we discuss several issues and caveats associated with estimates of the incubation distribution from such data. An important point is that short-term projections are considerably less sensitive to the assumed incubation-period distribution and the parametric model for the density of infection times than long-term projections. There is a temptation to use back-calculation to estimate current human immunodeficiency virus seroprevalence, and to make longer-term projections; however, such estimates are highly uncertain both because they are sensitive to model assumptions and because the AIDS incidence data provide more information about infections in the distant past than the near past.},

We find that the estimates are satisfactory except for the age-one survival rate. Usually the more days skipped between two visits, the more serious the underestimation of the age-one survival rate. We investigated the problem and developed three approaches to adjust for the underestimation bias.

  abstract = {Summary: Recent studies have shown that grassland birds are declining more rapidly than any other group of terrestrial birds. Current methods of estimating avian age-specific nest survival rates require knowing the ages of nests, assuming homogeneous nests in terms of nest survival rates, or treating the hazard function as a piecewise step function. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with nest-specific covariates to estimate age-specific daily survival probabilities without the above requirements. The model provides a smooth estimate of the nest survival curve and identifies the factors that are related to the nest survival. The model can handle irregular visiting schedules and it has the least restrictive assumptions compared to existing methods. Without assuming proportional hazards, we use a multinomial semiparametric logit model to specify a direct relation between age-specific nest failure probability and nest-specific covariates. An intrinsic autoregressive prior is employed for the nest age effect. This nonparametric prior provides a more flexible alternative to the parametric assumptions. The Bayesian computation is efficient because the full conditional posterior distributions either have closed forms or are log concave. We use the method to analyze a Missouri dickcissel dataset and find that (1) nest survival is not homogeneous during the nesting period, and it reaches its lowest at the transition from incubation to nestling; and (2) nest survival is related to grass cover and vegetation height in the study area.},

Methods Through retrieval in PubMed and EMBASE, studies were included in two parts: meta-analysis of the household secondary attack rate (SAR) and case analysis of household pediatric infections. Results A total of 95 articles were included: 48 for meta-analysis and 47 for case analysis. Pediatric COVID-19 only comprised a minority of the household transmission. The total pooled household SAR of child index cases and contacts were 0.20 (95\% CI: 0.15-0.26) and 0.24 (95\% CI: 0.18-0.30). Lower household transmissibility was reported in both child index cases and contacts compared to adults (RR\,=\,0.64, 95\% CI: 0.50-0.81; RR=0.74, 95\% CI: 0.64-0.85). Younger children were as susceptible as the older children (RR=0.89, 95\% CI: 0.72-1.10). Through subgroup analyses of different variants and periods, increased household SAR was observed in children (Wild: 0.20; Alpha: 0.42; Delta: 0.35; Omicron: 0.56) and no significant difference was found in household SAR between children and adults when new variants dominated. Conclusions Although children were demonstrated not to be dominant in the household transmission, their transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on the rise as new variants emerge.},

Group testing offers a way to increase throughput by testing pools of combined samples; however, most proposed designs have not yet addressed key concerns over sensitivity loss and implementation feasibility. Here, we combined a mathematical model of epidemic spread and empirically derived viral kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 infections to identify pooling designs that are robust to changes in prevalence, and to ratify sensitivity losses against the time course of individual infections. We show that prevalence can be accurately estimated across a broad range, from 0.02\% to 20\%, using only a few dozen pooled tests, and using up to 400 times fewer tests than would be needed for individual identification. We then exhaustively evaluated the ability of different pooling designs to maximize the number of detected infections under various resource constraints, finding that simple pooling designs can identify up to 20 times as many true positives as individual testing with a given budget. We illustrate how pooling affects sensitivity and overall detection capacity during an epidemic and on each day post infection, finding that only 3\% of false negative tests occurred when individuals are sampled during the first week of infection following peak viral load, and that sensitivity loss is mainly attributable to individuals sampled at the end of infection when detection for limiting transmission has minimal benefit. Crucially, we confirmed that our theoretical results can be translated into practice using pooled human nasopharyngeal specimens by accurately estimating a 1\% prevalence among 2,304 samples using only 48 tests, and through pooled sample identification in a panel of 960 samples. Our results show that accounting for variation in sampled viral loads provides a nuanced picture of how pooling affects sensitivity to detect infections. Using simple, practical group testing designs can vastly increase surveillance capabilities in resource-limited settings. Simple group testing designs to improve SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in resource-constrained settings are identified using modeling and experimental data.

We defined 26 model versions, each having a unique combination of underlying compartmental structure and data type(s) considered as model output(s). Four compartmental model structures and three common data types in disease surveillance (incidence, prevalence and detected vector counts) were studied. The structural identifiability of some parameters varied depending on the type of model output. In general, models with multiple data types as outputs had more structurally identifiable parameters, than did models with a single data type as output.

Many methods exist that allow the estimation of Rt from case data. However, these are not easily adapted to point prevalence data nor can they infer Rt across periods of missing data. We developed a Bayesian P-spline model suitable for fitting to a wide range of epidemic time-series, including point-prevalence data. We demonstrate the utility of the model by fitting to periodic daily SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity data in England from the first 7 rounds (May 2020–December 2020) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Estimates of Rt over the period of two subsequent rounds (6–8 weeks) and single rounds (2–3 weeks) inferred using the Bayesian P-spline model were broadly consistent with estimates from a simple exponential model, with overlapping credible intervals. However, there were sometimes substantial differences in point estimates. The Bayesian P-spline model was further able to infer changes in Rt over shorter periods tracking a temporary increase above one during late-May 2020, a gradual increase in Rt over the summer of 2020 as restrictions were eased, and a reduction in Rt during England’s second national lockdown followed by an increase as the Alpha variant surged. The model is robust against both under-fitting and over-fitting and is able to interpolate between periods of available data; it is a particularly versatile model when growth rate can change over small timescales, as in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This work highlights the importance of pairing robust methods with representative samples to track pandemics.},

  abstract = {Background:               A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number               R               0               , variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others.                                         Methods:               We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the~World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution.                                         Results:               Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of               R               0               (2-3), the overdispersion parameter               k               of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95\% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80\% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (\textasciitilde 10\%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for               R               0               and               k               (95\% CrIs:               R               0               1.4-12;               k               0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of               R               0               was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution.                                         Conclusions:               Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.},

  abstract = {We present a principled technique for estimating the effect of covariates on malaria parasite clearance rates in the presence of “lag” and “tail” phases through the use of a Bayesian hierarchical linear model. The hierarchical approach enables us to appropriately incorporate the uncertainty in both estimating clearance rates in patients and assessing the potential impact of covariates on these rates into the posterior intervals generated for the parameters associated with each covariate. Furthermore, it permits us to incorporate information about individuals for whom there exists only one observation time before censoring, which alleviates a systematic bias affecting inference when these individuals are excluded. We use a changepoint model to account for both lag and tail phases, and hence base our estimation of the parasite clearance rate only on observations within the decay phase. The Bayesian approach allows us to treat the delineation between lag, decay, and tail phases within an individual's clearance profile as themselves being random variables, thus taking into account the additional uncertainty of boundaries between phases. We compare our method to existing methodology used in the antimalarial research community through a simulation study and show that it possesses desirable frequentist properties for conducting inference. We use our methodology to measure the impact of several covariates on Plasmodium falciparum clearance rate data collected in 2009 and 2010. Though our method was developed with this application in mind, it can be easily applied to any biological system exhibiting these hindrances to estimation.},

Data may be collected in the most expedient manner, either as prevalence or incidence series of cases, and the results expressed as both incidence and prevalence. Information about the distribution of total durations of the condition in an incidence series of cases, or about the distribution of total durations or durations-to-date in a prevalence series is necessary in order to use these relations between prevalence and incidence of a condition or illness. The duration of a condition may be taken as one measure of the effect of the condition or illness on a population, and a “treatment effect” measured by comparing two populations may be termed the etiologic duration. Exact methods are presented for interconverting the distribution of total durations of condition among prevalence and incidence series of cases arising from the same steady-state population. Both prevalence and incidence series of cases may naturally arise in the same epidemiologic study, such as the initiation and conduct of a periodic screening program, and under certain conditions the size and even the direction of the etiologic duration may differ as measured in corresponding prevalence and incidence series of cases.},

Not only it is difficult to accurately model the inherent non-stationarity and heterogeneity of transmission, but it is nearly impossible to describe, mechanistically, changes in extrinsic environmental factors including public behaviour and seasonal fluctuations. An elegant approach to capturing environmental stochasticity is to model the force of infection as a stochastic process. However, inference in this context requires solving a computationally expensive “missing data” problem, using data-augmentation techniques. We propose to model the time-varying transmission-potential as an approximate diffusion process using a path-wise series expansion of Brownian motion. This approximation replaces the “missing data” imputation step with the inference of the expansion coefficients: a simpler and computationally cheaper task. We illustrate the merit of this approach through three examples: modelling influenza using a canonical SIR model, capturing seasonality using a SIRS model, and the modelling of COVID-19 pandemic using a multi-type SEIR model.},

Estimation of this quantity from surveillance data is hard because there is incomplete knowledge about (i) the time between infection and diagnosis (TI) for the general population, and (ii) the time between immigration and diagnosis for foreign-born persons.We developed a new statistical method for estimating the incidence of HIV-1 and the number of undiagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV), based on dynamic modelling of heterogeneous HIV-1 surveillance data. The methods consist of a Bayesian non-linear mixed effects model using multiple biomarkers to estimate TI of HIV-1-positive individuals, and a novel incidence estimator which distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous infections by modelling explicitly the probability that a foreign-born person was infected either before or after immigration. The incidence estimator allows for direct calculation of the number of undiagnosed persons. The new methodology is illustrated combining heterogeneous surveillance data from Sweden between 2003 and 2015.A leave-one-out cross-validation study showed that the multiple-biomarker model was more accurate than single biomarkers (mean absolute error 1.01 vs ≥1.95). We estimate that 816 [95\% credible interval (CI) 775-865] PLHIV were undiagnosed in 2015, representing a proportion of 10.8\% (95\% CI 10.3-11.4\%) of all PLHIV.The proposed methodology will enhance the utility of standard surveillance data streams and will be useful to monitor progress towards and compliance with the 90–90-90 UNAIDS target.},

Mathematical modelling based on scarce empirical evidence and key assumptions has driven isolation and testing policy, but real-world data are needed. We aimed to characterise infectiousness across the full course of infection in a real-world community setting. Methods The Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts (ATACCC) study was a UK prospective, longitudinal, community cohort of contacts of newly diagnosed, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index cases. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. The primary objective was to define the window of SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness and its temporal correlation with symptom onset. We quantified viral RNA load by RT-PCR and infectious viral shedding by enumerating cultivable virus daily across the course of infection. Participants completed a daily diary to track the emergence of symptoms. Outcomes were assessed with empirical data and a phenomenological Bayesian hierarchical model. Findings Between Sept 13, 2020, and March 31, 2021, we enrolled 393 contacts from 327 households (the SARS-CoV-2 pre-alpha and alpha variant waves); and between May 24, 2021, and Oct 28, 2021, we enrolled 345 contacts from 215 households (the delta variant wave). 173 of these 738 contacts were PCR positive for more than one timepoint, 57 of which were at the start of infection and comprised the final study population. The onset and end of infectious viral shedding were captured in 42 cases and the median duration of infectiousness was 5 (IQR 3–7) days. Although 24 (63\%) of 38 cases had PCR-detectable virus before symptom onset, only seven (20\%) of 35 shed infectious virus presymptomatically. Symptom onset was a median of 3 days before both peak viral RNA and peak infectious viral load (viral RNA IQR 3–5 days, n=38; plaque-forming units IQR 3–6 days, n=35). Notably, 22 (65\%) of 34 cases and eight (24\%) of 34 cases continued to shed infectious virus 5 days and 7 days post-symptom onset, respectively (survival probabilities 67\% and 35\%). Correlation of lateral flow device (LFD) results with infectious viral shedding was poor during the viral growth phase (sensitivity 67\% [95\% CI 59–75]), but high during the decline phase (92\% [86–96]). Infectious virus kinetic modelling suggested that the initial rate of viral replication determines the course of infection and infectiousness. Interpretation Less than a quarter of COVID-19 cases shed infectious virus before symptom onset; under a crude 5-day self-isolation period from symptom onset, two-thirds of cases released into the community would still be infectious, but with reduced infectious viral shedding. Our findings support a role for LFDs to safely accelerate deisolation but not for early diagnosis, unless used daily. These high-resolution, community-based data provide evidence to inform infection control guidance. Funding National Institute for Health and Care Research.},

Both informative priors and noninformative priors are investigated. The reference prior under this model is derived, and, therefore, the hyperparameter specification problem is solved to some extent. The Bayesian method provides a more accurate estimate of the total survival rate than the standard Mayfield method, if the age-specific hazard rates are not constant. The Bayesian method also lets the biologist look for high- and low-survival rates during the whole nesting period. In practice, it is common for data of several types to be collected in a single study. That is, some nests may be aged, others are not. Some nests are visited regularly; others are visited irregularly. The Bayesian method accommodates any mix of these sampling techniques by assuming that the aging and visiting activities have no effect on the survival rate. The methods are illustrated by an analysis of the Missouri northern bobwhite data set.},

Independent beta priors are placed on the age-specific hazard rates and conditional encounter rates. A two-stage hierarchical prior is placed on the number of encountered nests. Four types of latent variables are introduced to simplify the likelihood function. A class of informative and noninformative priors is given for the unknown number of nests encountered. We find some mild condition so that the posterior is proper. All the conditional posterior densities are standard densities such as beta, gamma, Poisson, negative binomial, and multinormal. Therefore, the Gibbs sampling computation is efficient. The reference prior under this model is derived, and the hyperparameter specification problem is solved to some extent. The simulation result shows that the proposed Bayesian model provides accurate and stable estimates of survival rates. The model also is applied to a real-nest data set.},

In this framework, the appropriate view of nest failure is that of a continuous time process which may be observed only periodically. The timing of study entry and subsequent observations, as well as assumptions about the underlying continuous time process, uniquely determines the appropriate analysis via the data likelihood. We describe how continuous-time hazard-function models form a natural basis for this approach. Nonparametric and parametric approaches are presented, but we focus primarily on the middle ground of weakly structured approaches and how they can be performed with software such as SAS PROC NLMIXED. The hazard function approach leads to complementary log-log (cloglog) link survival models, also known as discrete proportional-hazards models. We show that cloglog models have a close connection to the logistic-exposure and related models, and hence these models share similar desirable properties. We raise some cautions about the application of random effects, or frailty, models to nest-survival studies, and suggest directions that software development might take.},

  abstract = {Probability modelling for DNA sequence evolution is well established and provides a rich framework for understanding genetic variation between samples of individuals from one or more populations. We show that both classical and more recent models for coalescence (with or without recombination) can be described in terms of the so-called phase-type theory, where complicated and tedious calculations are circumvented by the use of matrix manipulations. The application of phase-type theory in population genetics consists of describing the biological system as a Markov model by appropriately setting up a state space and calculating the corresponding intensity and reward matrices. Formulae of interest are then expressed in terms of these aforementioned matrices. We illustrate this procedure by a number of examples: (a)~Calculating the mean, (co)variance and even higher order moments of the site frequency spectrum in multiple merger coalescent models, (b)~Analysing a sample of DNA sequences from the Atlantic Cod using the Beta-coalescent, and (c)~Determining the correlation of the number of segregating sites for multiple samples in the two-locus ancestral recombination graph. We believe that phase-type theory has great potential as a tool for analysing probability models in population genetics. The compact matrix notation is useful for clarification of current models, and in particular their formal manipulation and calculations, but also for further development or extensions.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

  abstract = {Background School closure is a potential intervention during an influenza pandemic and has been investigated in many modelling studies. Objectives To systematically review the effects of school closure on influenza outbreaks as predicted by simulation studies. Methods We searched Medline and Embase for relevant modelling studies published by the end of October 2012, and handsearched key journals. We summarised the predicted effects of school closure on the peak and cumulative attack rates and the duration of the epidemic. We investigated how these predictions depended on the basic reproduction number, the timing and duration of closure and the assumed effects of school closures on contact patterns. Results School closures were usually predicted to be most effective if they caused large reductions in contact, if transmissibility was low (e.g. a basic reproduction number {$<$}2), and if attack rates were higher in children than in adults. The cumulative attack rate was expected to change less than the peak, but quantitative predictions varied (e.g. reductions in the peak were frequently 20–60\% but some studies predicted {$>$}90\% reductions or even increases under certain assumptions). This partly reflected differences in model assumptions, such as those regarding population contact patterns. Conclusions Simulation studies suggest that school closure can be a useful control measure during an influenza pandemic, particularly for reducing peak demand on health services. However, it is difficult to accurately quantify the likely benefits. Further studies of the effects of reactive school closures on contact patterns are needed to improve the accuracy of model predictions.},

We examined 25,381 German SARS-CoV-2 cases, including 6110 from test centres attended by pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly-symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalised, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The youngest had mean log10 viral load 0.5 (or less) lower than older subjects and an estimated \textasciitilde 78\% of the peak cell culture replication probability, due in part to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8\% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with mean age 37.6. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (8.1) and cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than non-B.1.1.7, with estimated cell culture replication probability 2.6 times higher.},

  abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

  abstract = {The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2–3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level persistent viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95\% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95\% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95\% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95\% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient’s infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patient’s progress through infection stages. Frequent, rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.},

Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with presymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the reopening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are too low to detect, followed by exponential viral growth, leading to peak viral load and infectiousness and ending with declining titers and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary. Test sensitivity is secondary to frequency and turnaround time for COVID-19 screening. Test sensitivity is secondary to frequency and turnaround time for COVID-19 screening.},

A well-known example of such data is given by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cohort study in which the two events are HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis, and several inference methods have been developed in the literature for their regression analysis. However, all of them only apply to limited situations or focus on a single model. In this paper, we propose a marginal likelihood approach based on a general class of semiparametric transformation models, which can be applied to much more general situations. For the implementation, we develop a two-step procedure that makes use of both the multiple imputation technique and a novel EM algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established by using the modern empirical process theory, and the simulation study conducted suggests that the method works well in practical situations. An application is also provided.},

A new analysis of outbreak data shows that individual differences in infectiousness exert powerful influences on the epidemiology of ten deadly diseases. SARS and measles (and perhaps avian influenza) show strong tendencies towards ‘superspreading events’ that can ignite explosive epidemics — but this same volatility makes outbreaks more likely to fizzle out. Smallpox and pneumonic plague, two potential bioterrorism agents, show steadier growth but still differ markedly from the traditional average-based view.

The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex. Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major effect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems.},

  abstract = {"Preface. History. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in which plausible values for unknown quantities are simulated from their appropriate probability distribution, have revolutionised the practice of statistics. For more than 20 years the BUGS project has been at the forefront of this movement. The BUGS project began in Cambridge, in 1989, just as Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith were working 80 miles away in Nottingham on their classic Gibbs sampler paper (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) that kicked off the revolution. But we never communicated (except through the intermediate node of David Clayton) and whereas the Gelfand-Smith approach used image-processing as inspiration, the philosophy behind BUGS was rooted more in techniques for handling uncertainty in artificial intelligence using directed graphical models and what came to be called Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988). Lunn et al. (2009b) lay out all this history in greater detail. Some people have accused Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of being slow, but nothing could compare with the time it has taken this book to be written! The first proposal dates from 1995, but things got in the way, as they do, and it needed a vigorous new generation of researchers to finally get it finished. It is slightly galling that much of the current book could have been written in the mid-1990s, since the basic ideas of the software, the language for model description, and indeed some of the examples are unchanged. Nevertheless there have been important developments in the extended gestational period of the book, for example techniques for model criticism and comparison, implementation of differential equations and nonparametric techniques, and the ability to run BUGS code within a range of alternative programs"--},

We describe a sampling-based inverse prediction method for predicting time from HIV infection to attainment of the CD4 cell threshold and apply it to a set of treatment naive HIV-infected subjects in a village in Botswana who participated in a household survey that collected cross-sectional CD4 cell counts. The inferential target of interest is the population level mean time to reaching the CD4 cell-based treatment threshold in this group of subjects. To address the challenges arising from the fact that these subjects’ dates of HIV infection are unknown, we make use of data from an auxiliary cohort study of subjects enrolled shortly after HIV infection in which CD4 cell counts were measured over time. We use a multiple-imputation framework to combine across the different sources of data, and we discuss how the methods compensate for the length-biased sampling that is inherent in cross-sectional screening procedures, such as household surveys. We comment on how the results bear on analyses of costs of implementation of treatment-for-prevention use of antiretroviral drugs in HIV prevention interventions.},

Here, we report on the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 determined by analysing the sequenced samples collected by the ONS-CIS during this period. We observed a series of sweeps or partial sweeps, with each sweeping lineage having a distinct growth advantage compared to their predecessors, although this was also accompanied by a gradual fall in average viral burdens from June 2021 to March 2023. The sweeps also generated an alternating pattern in which most samples had either S-gene target failure (SGTF) or non-SGTF over time. Evolution was characterized by steadily increasing divergence and diversity within lineages, but with step increases in divergence associated with each sweeping major lineage. This led to a faster overall rate of evolution when measured at the between-lineage level compared to within lineages, and fluctuating levels of diversity. These observations highlight the value of viral sequencing integrated into community surveillance studies to monitor the viral epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other pathogens.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. Design Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. Setting International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. Results The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95\% CIs) of 1.63 (95\% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95\% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95\% CIs) was 5.8 (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95\% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95\% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95\% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.},

However, estimation of these quantities became challenging with the scaling down of surveillance systems as part of the transition from the “emergency” to “endemic” phase of the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) provided an opportunity to continue estimating these parameters in the absence of other data streams. We used a penalised spline model fitted to the ONS CIS test positivity estimates to produce a smoothed estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity over time. The resulting fitted curve was used to estimate the “ONS-based” R(t) and r(t) across the four nations of the UK. Estimates produced under this model are compared to government-published estimates with particular consideration given to the contribution that this single data stream can offer in the estimation of these parameters. Depending on the nation and parameter, we found that up to 77\% of the variance in the government-published estimates can be explained by the ONS-based estimates, demonstrating the value of this singular data stream to track the epidemic in each of the four nations. We additionally find that the ONS-based estimates uncover epidemic trends earlier than the corresponding government-published estimates. Our work shows that the ONS CIS can be used to generate the key COVID-19 epidemics across the four UK nations. This is not intended as an alternative to ensemble modelling, rather it is intended as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge faced by public health officials in the UK in early 2022.},

Given the known association of socioeconomic status and increased vulnerability to infection and mortality, it is also critical that such models further incorporate social heterogeneities. Methods Here, we aimed to explore the influence of integrating income-associated differences in parameters of traditional dynamic transmission models. We developed a measles SIR model, in which the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered classes were stratified by income quintile, with income-specific transmission rates, disease-induced mortality rates, and vaccination coverage levels. We further provided a stylized illustration with secondary data from Ethiopia, where we examined various scenarios demonstrating differences in transmission patterns by income and in distributional vaccination coverage, and quantified impacts on disparities in measles mortality. Results The income-stratified SIR model exhibited similar dynamics to that of the traditional SIR model, with amplified outbreak peaks and measles mortality among the poorest income group. All vaccination coverage strategies were found to substantially curb the overall number of measles deaths, yet most considerably for the poorest, with select strategies yielding clear reductions in measles mortality disparities. Discussion The incorporation of income-specific differences can reveal distinct outbreak patterns across income groups and important differences in the subsequent effects of preventative interventions like vaccination. Our case study highlights the need to extend traditional modeling frameworks (e.g. SIR models) to be stratified by socioeconomic factors like income and to consider ensuing income-associated differences in disease-related morbidity and mortality. In so doing, we build on existing tools and characterize ongoing challenges in achieving health equity.},

  abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

Efficiency of our algorithm hinges on narrowing the search space to a particular subset of the PH distributions, which we refer to as Erlang–Coxian (EC) distributions. The class of EC distributions has a small number of parameters, and we provide closed form solutions for these. Our solution applies to any distribution whose first three moments can be matched by a PH distribution.

  abstract = {Early assessments of the growth rate of COVID-19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but as cases were recorded in multiple countries, more robust inferences could be made. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we estimated that, when unconstrained, European COVID-19 confirmed cases doubled on average every 3 days (range 2.2–4.3 days) and Italian hospital and intensive care unit admissions every 2–3 days; values that are significantly lower than the 5–7 days dominating the early published literature. Furthermore, we showed that the impact of physical distancing interventions was typically not seen until at least 9 days after implementation, during which time confirmed cases could grow eightfold. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the time-insensitive basic reproduction number R0 for initiating interventions, and that the combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' outbreak response better than large values of R0 alone. One year on from first reporting these results, reproduction numbers continue to dominate the media and public discourse, but robust estimates of unconstrained growth remain essential for planning worst-case scenarios, and detection delays are still key in informing the relaxation and re-implementation of interventions. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Modelling that shaped the early COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK’.},

Here, we provide a formal definition and discuss the advantages and most common misconceptions around this quantity. We consider the intuition behind different formulations of R\$\$ R \$\$, the complexities in its estimation (including the unavoidable lags involved), and its value compared to other indicators (e.g. the growth rate) that can be directly observed from aggregate surveillance data and react more promptly to changes in epidemic trend. As models become more sophisticated, with age and/or spatial structure, formulating R\$\$ R \$\$ becomes increasingly complicated and inevitably model-dependent. We present some models currently used in the UK pandemic response as examples. Ultimately, limitations in the available data streams, data quality and time constraints force pragmatic choices to be made on a quantity that is an average across time, space, social structure and settings. Effectively communicating these challenges is important but often difficult in an emergency.},

  abstract = {Modern viral kinetic modeling and its application to therapeutics is a field that attracted the attention of the medical, pharmaceutical, and modeling communities during the early days of the AIDS epidemic. Its successes led to applications of modeling methods not only to HIV but a plethora of other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus, which along with HIV cause chronic diseases, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which generally cause acute infections. Here we first review the historical development of mathematical models to understand HIV and HCV infections and the effects of treatment by fitting the models to clinical data. We then focus on recent efforts and contributions of applying these models towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight outstanding questions where modeling can provide crucial insights and help to optimize nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The review is written from our personal perspective emphasizing the power of simple target cell limited models that provided important insights and then their evolution into more complex models that captured more of the virology and immunology. To quote Albert Einstein, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler,” and this idea underlies the modeling we describe below.},

Not accounting for vaccination status through post-stratification led to small underestimation of PCR positivity, but more substantial overestimations of antibody levels in the population (up to 21\%), particularly in groups with low vaccine uptake in the general population. There was marked variation in the relative contribution of different areas and age-groups to each wave. Future analyses of infectious disease surveys should take into account major drivers of outcomes of interest that may also influence participation, with vaccination being an important factor to consider.},

Although these assays show variation in cycle threshold values (Ct), advocacy for reporting Ct values (in addition to the qualitative result) is tabled to guide patient clinical management decisions. This article provides critical commentary on qualitative RTPCR laboratory and clinical considerations for Ct value reporting. Factors contributing to Ct variation are discussed by considering relevant viral life-cycle factors, patient factors and the laboratory total testing processes that contribute to the Ct variation and mitigate against the reporting of Ct values by qualitative NAAT.},

Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54\%, 95\% UI 31–81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95\% UI 0·62–1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50\%, 95\% UI 28–77; RR 0·88, 0·66–1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50\%, 95\% UI 23–81; RR 0·88, 0·60–1·43) if all tests are returned negative.

  abstract = {Objective To understand community seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents. This is vital to understanding the susceptibility of this cohort to COVID-19 and to inform public health policy for disease control such as immunisation. Design We conducted a community-based cross-sectional seroprevalence study in participants aged 0–18 years old recruiting from seven regions in England between October 2019 and June 2021 and collecting extensive demographic and symptom data. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins using Roche assays processed at UK Health Security Agency laboratories. Prevalence estimates were calculated for six time periods and were standardised by age group, ethnicity and National Health Service region. Results Post-first wave (June–August 2020), the (anti-spike IgG) adjusted seroprevalence was 5.2\%, varying from 0.9\% (participants 10–14 years old) to 9.5\% (participants 5–9 years old). By April–June 2021, this had increased to 19.9\%, varying from 13.9\% (participants 0–4 years old) to 32.7\% (participants 15–18 years old). Minority ethnic groups had higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity than white participants (OR 1.4, 95\% CI 1.0 to 2.0), after adjusting for sex, age, region, time period, deprivation and urban/rural geography. In children {$<$}10 years, there were no symptoms or symptom clusters that reliably predicted seropositivity. Overall, 48\% of seropositive participants with complete questionnaire data recalled no symptoms between February 2020 and their study visit. Conclusions Approximately one-third of participants aged 15–18 years old had evidence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 prior to the introduction of widespread vaccination. These data demonstrate that ethnic background is independently associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Trial registration number NCT04061382.},

We present a regression approach to backcalculation of flexible linear models of the HIV infection curve. These models include step functions and splines. Because expected AIDS incidence can be expressed as a linear function of unknown parameters, regression methods may be used to obtain parameter and covariance estimates for a variety of interesting quantities, such as the expected number of people infected in previous time intervals and the projected AIDS incidence in future time intervals. We exploit these ideas to show that estimates based on maximum likelihood are, for practical purposes, equivalent to approximate estimates based on quasi-likelihood and on Poisson regression. These algorithms are readily implemented on a personal computer. We illustrate by projecting AIDS incidence in the USA.},

  abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The emergence of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) during 2020-22, each exhibiting increased epidemic growth relative to earlier circulating variants, has created a need to understand the drivers of such growth. However, both pathogen biology and changing host characteristics – such as varying levels of immunity – can combine to influence replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within and between hosts. Disentangling the role of variant and host in individual-level viral shedding of VOCs is essential to inform COVID-19 planning and response, and interpret past epidemic trends. Using data from a prospective observational cohort study of healthy adult volunteers undergoing weekly occupational health PCR screening, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shaped viral dynamics, measured by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values over time. Jointly accounting for both inter-individual variation in Ct values and complex host characteristics – such as vaccination status, exposure history and age – we found that age and number of prior exposures had a strong influence on peak viral replication. Older individuals and those who had at least five prior antigen exposures to vaccination and/or infection typically had much lower levels of shedding. Moreover, we found evidence of a correlation between the speed of early shedding and duration of incubation period when comparing different VOCs and age groups. Our findings illustrate the value of linking information on participant characteristics, symptom profile and infecting variant with prospective PCR sampling, and the importance of accounting for increasingly complex population exposure landscapes when analysing the viral kinetics of VOCs.},

  abstract = {Traditional machine learning focuses on the situation where a fixed number of features are available for each data-point. For medical applications each individual patient will typically have a different set of clinical tests associated with them. This results in a varying number of observed per patient features. An important indicator of interest in medical domains is survival information. Survival data presents its own particular challenges such as censoring. The aim of this thesis is to explore how machine learning ideas can be transferred to the domain of clinical data analysis. We consider two primary challenges; firstly how survival models can be made more flexible through non-linearisation and secondly methods for missing data imputation in order to handle the varying number of observed per patient features. We use the framework of Gaussian process modelling to facilitate conflation of our approaches; allowing the dual challenges of survival data and missing data to be addressed. The results show promise, although challenges remain. In particular when a large proportion of data is missing, greater uncertainty in inferences results. Principled handling of this uncertainty requires propagation through any Gaussian process model used for subsequent regression.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) can severely underestimate the survival probabilities at early times for left-truncated and interval-censored (LT-IC) data. For arbitrarily truncated and censored data, Pan and Chappel (JAMA Stat Probab Lett 38:49–57, 1998a, Biometrics 54:1053–1060, 1998b) proposed a nonparametric estimator of the survival function, called the iterative Nelson estimator (INE). Their simulation study showed that the INE performed well in overcoming the under-estimation of the survival function from the NPMLE for LT-IC data. In this article, we revisit the problem of inconsistency of the NPMLE. We point out that the inconsistency is caused by the likelihood function of the left-censored observations, where the left-truncated variables are used as the left endpoints of censoring intervals. This can lead to severe underestimation of the survival function if the NPMLE is obtained using Turnbull’s (JAMA 38:290–295, 1976) EM algorithm. To overcome this problem, we propose a modified maximum likelihood estimator (MMLE) based on a modified likelihood function, where the left endpoints of censoring intervals for left-censored observations are the maximum of left-truncated variables and the estimated left endpoint of the support of the left-censored times. Simulation studies show that the MMLE performs well for finite sample and outperforms both the INE and NPMLE.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

  abstract = {Background The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and spreading globally, including in populations with high vaccination rates. We aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community. Methods Between Sept 13, 2020, and Sept 15, 2021, 602 community contacts (identified via the UK contract-tracing system) of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta infection (n=29) with unvaccinated individuals with delta (n=16), alpha (B.1.1.7; n=39), and pre-alpha (n=49) infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological analysis were to assess the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household contacts stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases’ vaccination status. Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences in the peak viral load, viral growth rate, and viral decline rate between participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status. Findings The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25\% (95\% CI 18–33) for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38\% (24–53) in unvaccinated individuals. The median time between second vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals (median 101 days [IQR 74–120]) than for uninfected individuals (64 days [32–97], p=0·001). SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25\% [95\% CI 15–35] for vaccinated vs 23\% [15–31] for unvaccinated). 12 (39\%) of 31 infections in fully vaccinated household contacts arose from fully vaccinated epidemiologically linked index cases, further confirmed by genomic and virological analysis in three index case–contact pairs. Although peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or variant type, it increased modestly with age (difference of 0·39 [95\% credible interval –0·03 to 0·79] in peak log10 viral load per mL between those aged 10 years and 50 years). Fully vaccinated individuals with delta variant infection had a faster (posterior probability {$>$}0·84) mean rate of viral load decline (0·95 log10 copies per mL per day) than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (0·69), alpha (0·82), or delta (0·79) variant infections. Within individuals, faster viral load growth was correlated with higher peak viral load (correlation 0·42 [95\% credible interval 0·13 to 0·65]) and slower decline (–0·44 [–0·67 to –0·18]). Interpretation Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts. Host–virus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory. Funding National Institute for Health Research.},

In these situations, doubly interval-censored observations occur mainly because of the nature of the disease and/or the structure of the study design. Doubly interval-censored failure-time data include usual right- or interval-censored failure-time data as special cases. The analysis of doubly interval-censored data has recently attracted much attention, especially in the context of the analysis of AIDS incubation time. The chapter discusses nonparametric estimation of the distribution of the survival time of interest by considering the situation where no truncation exists and the situation with truncation on observations on the occurrence of subsequent events. Several algorithms are described and compared for the nonparametric estimation. The chapter deals with regression analysis of doubly interval-censored failure-time data by discussing two methods for fitting the proportional hazards model to the data. The problem of nonparametric comparison of survival functions based on doubly interval-censored failure-time data is considered and some discussion and directions for future researches are mentioned.},

  abstract = {In the past few years a number of antibody biomarkers have been developed to distinguish between recent and established Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Typically, a specific threshold/cut-off of the biomarker is chosen, values below which are indicative of recent infections. Such biomarkers have attracted considerable interest as the basis for incidence estimation using a cross-sectional sample. An estimate of HIV incidence can be obtained from the prevalence of recent infection, as measured in the sample, and knowledge of the time spent in the recent infection state, known as the window period. However, such calculations are based on a number of assumptions concerning the distribution of the window period. We compare two statistical methods for estimating the mean and distribution of a window period using data on repeated measurements of an antibody biomarker from a cohort of HIV seroconverters. The methods account for the interval-censored nature of both the date of seroconversion and the date of crossing a specific threshold. We illustrate the methods using repeated measurements of the Avidity Index (AI) and make recommendations about the choice of threshold for this biomarker so that the resulting window period satisfies the assumptions for incidence estimation.

  abstract = {Social distancing is an important public health intervention to reduce or interrupt the sustained community transmission of emerging infectious pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Contact matrices are typically used when evaluating such public health interventions to account for the heterogeneity in social mixing of individuals, but the surveys used to obtain the number of contacts often lack detailed information on the time individuals spend on daily activities. The present work addresses this problem by combining the large-scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time-use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group (0--15, 16--24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+ years) and daily activity (work, schooling, transportation, and four leisure activities: social visits, bar/cafe/restaurant visits, park visits, and non-essential shopping). This augmentation allows exploring the impact of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities as well as when lifting such restrictions again. For illustration, the derived matrices were then applied to an age-structured dynamic-transmission model of coronavirus disease 2019. Findings show how contact matrices can be successfully augmented with time-use data to inform the relative reductions in contacts by activity, which allows for more fine-grained mixing patterns and infectious disease modelling.},

  abstract = {Rationale Amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in which many countries have adopted physical distancing measures, tiered restrictions, and episodic “lockdowns,” the impact of potentially increased social mixing during festive holidays on the age distribution of new COVID-19 cases remains unclear. Objective We aimed to gain insights into possible changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in the UK after temporarily increased intergenerational interactions in late December 2020. Method We modelled changes in time use and social mixing based on age-stratified contact rates using historical nationally-representative surveys and up-to-date Google mobility data from four weeks before and after the festive period. We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) “normal”: time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) “pre-lockdown”: patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) “lockdown”: patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) “festive break”: similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1. Results Across ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3. Conclusions Our modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays. HighlightsHome visits are associated with increased intergenerational mixing.The effective reproduction number is likely to remain stable or even reduce slightly due to a reduction in contacts at work and school.Relative incidence is likely to become lower in children, but higher in theolder (more vulnerable) age groups around the holiday period, which could lead to increased health care burden.},

Traditional Rˆ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of contact-tracing and population-based studies at low risk of bias. Methods We searched 4 electronic databases on 28 July 2021 for contact-tracing studies and population-based studies informative about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from 0 to 19 year olds in household or educational settings. We excluded studies at high risk of bias, including from under-ascertainment of asymptomatic infections. We undertook multilevel random effects meta-analyses of secondary attack rates (SAR: contact-tracing studies) and school infection prevalence, and used meta-regression to examine the impact of community SARS-CoV-2 incidence on school infection prevalence. Findings 4529 abstracts were reviewed, resulting in 37 included studies (16 contact-tracing; 19 population studies; 2 mixed studies). The pooled relative transmissibility of CYP compared with adults was 0.92 (0.68, 1.26) in adjusted household studies. The pooled SAR from CYP was lower (p~=~0.002) in school studies 0.7\% (0.2, 2.7) than household studies (7.6\% (3.6, 15.9) . There was no difference in SAR from CYP to child or adult contacts. School population studies showed some evidence of clustering in classes within schools. School infection prevalence was associated with contemporary community 14-day incidence (OR 1.003 (1.001, 1.004), p{$<$}0.001). Interpretation We found no difference in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from CYP compared with adults within household settings. SAR were markedly lower in school compared with household settings, suggesting that household transmission is more important than school transmission in this pandemic. School infection prevalence was associated with community infection incidence, supporting hypotheses that school infections broadly reflect community infections. These findings are important for guiding policy decisions on shielding, vaccination school and operations during the pandemic.},

Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models. Methods and Findings First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options. Conclusion This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

Large-scale community-based comparisons across multiple Omicron waves of reinfection characteristics, risk factors, and protection afforded by previous infection and vaccination, are limited, especially after widespread national testing stopped. We studied 245,895 adults ≥18y in the UK’s national COVID-19 Infection Survey with at least one infection (identified from positive swab tests done within the study, linked from national testing programmes, or self-reported by participants, up to their last study assessment). We quantified the risk of reinfection in multiple infection waves, including those driven by BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and most recently BQ.1/CH.1.1/XBB.1.5 variants, in which most reinfections occurred. Reinfections had higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (lower viral load) and lower percentages self-reporting symptoms compared with first infections. Across multiple Omicron waves, protection against reinfection was significantly higher in those previously infected with more recent than earlier variants, even at the same time from previous infection. Protection against Omicron reinfections decreased over time from the most recent infection if this was the previous or penultimate variant (generally within the preceding year), but did not change or even slightly increased over time if this was with an even earlier variant (generally {$>$}1 year previously). Those 14-180 days after receiving their most recent vaccination had a lower risk of reinfection with all Omicron variants except BA.2 than those {$>$}180 days from their most recent vaccination. Reinfection risk was independently higher in those aged 30-45 years, and with either low or high Ct values in their most recent previous infection. Overall, the risk of Omicron reinfection is high, but with lower severity than first infections; reinfection risk is likely driven as much by viral evolution as waning immunity.},

The essential ingredients of the model are a parametric linear model for covariate adjustment, a nonparametric estimation of a smooth time trend, serial correlation between measurements on an individual subject, and random measurement error. A back-fitting algorithm is used in conjunction with a cross-validation prescription to fit the model. A notable feature in the application is that the onset of HIV infection is associated with a sudden drop in CD4 cells followed by a longer-term slower decay. The model is also used to estimate an individual's curve by combining his data with the population curve. Shrinkage toward the population mean trajectory is controlled in a natural way by the estimated covariance structure of the data.},

The generation interval and latent period, though both are of importance in understanding the features of COVID-19 transmission, are difficult to observe, and thus they can rarely be learnt from surveillance data empirically. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the generation interval and incubation period simultaneously by using the contact tracing data of COVID-19 cases, and infer the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion and latent period thereafter. We estimate the mean of incubation period at 6.8 days (95 \%CI: 6.2, 7.5) and SD at 4.1 days (95 \%CI: 3.7, 4.8), and the mean of generation interval at 6.7 days (95 \%CI: 5.4, 7.6) and SD at 1.8 days (95 \%CI: 0.3, 3.8). The basic reproduction number is estimated ranging from 1.9 to 3.6, and there are 49.8 \% (95 \%CI: 33.3, 71.5) of the secondary COVID-19 infections likely due to pre-symptomatic transmission. Using the best estimates of model parameters, we further infer the mean latent period at 3.3 days (95 \%CI: 0.2, 7.9). Our findings highlight the importance of both isolation for symptomatic cases, and for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive, unified approach to modeling arbitrarily censored spatial survival data is presented for the three most commonly used semiparametric models: proportional hazards, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time. Unlike many other approaches, all manner of censored survival times are simultaneously accommodated including uncensored, interval censored, current-status, left and right censored, and mixtures of these. Left-truncated data are also accommodated leading to models for time-dependent covariates. Both georeferenced (location exactly observed) and areally observed (location known up to a geographic unit such as a county) spatial locations are handled; formal variable selection makes model selection especially easy. Model fit is assessed with conditional Cox–Snell residual plots, and model choice is carried out via log pseudo marginal likelihood (LPML) and deviance information criterion (DIC). Baseline survival is modeled with a novel transformed Bernstein polynomial prior. All models are fit via a new function which calls efficient compiled C++ in the R package spBayesSurv. The methodology is broadly illustrated with simulations and real data applications. An important finding is that proportional odds and accelerated failure time models often fit significantly better than the commonly used proportional hazards model.

  abstract = {Background Meta-analyses and single-site studies have established that children are less infectious than adults within a household when positive for ancestral SARS-CoV-2. In addition, children appear less susceptible to infection when exposed to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 within a household. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) has been associated with an increased number of paediatric infections worldwide. However, the role of children in the household transmission of VOC, relative to the ancestral virus, remains unclear. Aim We aimed to evaluate children\&apos;s role in household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Methods We perform a meta-analysis of the role of children in household transmission of both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Results Unlike with the ancestral virus, children infected with VOC spread SARS-CoV-2 to an equivalent number of household contacts as infected adults and were equally as likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 VOC from an infected family member. Interestingly, the same was observed when unvaccinated children exposed to VOC were compared with unvaccinated adults exposed to VOC. Conclusions These data suggest that the emergence of VOC was associated with a fundamental shift in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. It is unlikely that this is solely the result of age-dependent differences in vaccination during the VOC period and may instead reflect virus evolution over the course of the pandemic.},
