  abstract = {Estimation of the incubation period distribution of human immunodeficiency virus based on prevalent cohorts of subjects, already infected at the time of recruitment, is complicated by the absence of information on the original times of infection. Here, we overcome this difficulty by using a prior distribution for the infection times, based on external data. Our estimate is nonparametric, but uses smoothness assumptions to avoid instability. The method is illustrated on two prevalent cohorts from San Francisco, separately and combined. The estimates produced agree with other published estimates of the incubation period distribution.}

In this paper, we study the performance of the Bayesian model (He, 2003, Biometrics59, 962–973) for age-specific nest survival rates with irregular visits. We find that the estimates are satisfactory except for the age-one survival rate. Usually the more days skipped between two visits, the more serious the underestimation of the age-one survival rate. We investigated the problem and developed three approaches to adjust for the underestimation bias. The simulation results show that the three approaches can significantly improve the estimation of the age-one survival rate.},

  abstract = {Summary: Recent studies have shown that grassland birds are declining more rapidly than any other group of terrestrial birds. Current methods of estimating avian age-specific nest survival rates require knowing the ages of nests, assuming homogeneous nests in terms of nest survival rates, or treating the hazard function as a piecewise step function. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with nest-specific covariates to estimate age-specific daily survival probabilities without the above requirements. The model provides a smooth estimate of the nest survival curve and identifies the factors that are related to the nest survival. The model can handle irregular visiting schedules and it has the least restrictive assumptions compared to existing methods. Without assuming proportional hazards, we use a multinomial semiparametric logit model to specify a direct relation between age-specific nest failure probability and nest-specific covariates. An intrinsic autoregressive prior is employed for the nest age effect. This nonparametric prior provides a more flexible alternative to the parametric assumptions. The Bayesian computation is efficient because the full conditional posterior distributions either have closed forms or are log concave. We use the method to analyze a Missouri dickcissel dataset and find that (1) nest survival is not homogeneous during the nesting period, and it reaches its lowest at the transition from incubation to nestling; and (2) nest survival is related to grass cover and vegetation height in the study area.},

Independent beta priors are placed on the age-specific hazard rates and conditional encounter rates. A two-stage hierarchical prior is placed on the number of encountered nests. Four types of latent variables are introduced to simplify the likelihood function. A class of informative and noninformative priors is given for the unknown number of nests encountered. We find some mild condition so that the posterior is proper. All the conditional posterior densities are standard densities such as beta, gamma, Poisson, negative binomial, and multinormal. Therefore, the Gibbs sampling computation is efficient. The reference prior under this model is derived, and the hyperparameter specification problem is solved to some extent. The simulation result shows that the proposed Bayesian model provides accurate and stable estimates of survival rates. The model also is applied to a real-nest data set.},

Both informative priors and noninformative priors are investigated. The reference prior under this model is derived, and, therefore, the hyperparameter specification problem is solved to some extent. The Bayesian method provides a more accurate estimate of the total survival rate than the standard Mayfield method, if the age-specific hazard rates are not constant. The Bayesian method also lets the biologist look for high- and low-survival rates during the whole nesting period. In practice, it is common for data of several types to be collected in a single study. That is, some nests may be aged, others are not. Some nests are visited regularly; others are visited irregularly. The Bayesian method accommodates any mix of these sampling techniques by assuming that the aging and visiting activities have no effect on the survival rate. The methods are illustrated by an analysis of the Missouri northern bobwhite data set.},

We present a general bivariate contingency table approach for analyzing such data. We use weakly structured step spline hazard models, which avoid estimability problems encountered in a strictly nonparametric approach, yet still permit flexibility. Our method eliminates a potential source of bias noted by Heisey and Nordheim (1990, Biometrics 46, 855-862) in the nest survival method of Pollock and Cornelius (1988, Biometrics 44, 397-404).

  abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This method is then used to analyze two AIDS cohort studies, for which direct use of the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1976, Journal of the Royal Statistical Association, Series B 39, 1-38), which is computationally complicated, has previously been the usual method of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Gomez and Lagakos (1994) propose a nonparametric method for estimating the distribution of a survival time when the origin and end points defining the survival time suffer interval-censoring and right-censoring, respectively. In some situations, the end point also suffers interval-censoring as well as truncation. In this paper, we consider this general situation and propose a two-step estimation procedure for the estimation of the distribution of a survival time based on doubly interval-censored and truncated data. The proposed method generalizes the methods proposed by DeGruttola and Lagakos (1989) and Sun (1995) and is more efficient than that given in Gomez and Lagakos (1994). The approach is based on self-consistency equations. The method is illustrated by an analysis of an AIDS cohort study.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the statistical analysis of doubly interval-censored failure-time data. One field that often sees doubly interval-censored failure-time data is disease progression or epidemiological studies where initial and subsequent events may represent infection and subsequent onset of certain disease, respectively. In these situations, doubly interval-censored observations occur mainly because of the nature of the disease and/or the structure of the study design. Doubly interval-censored failure-time data include usual right- or interval-censored failure-time data as special cases. The analysis of doubly interval-censored data has recently attracted much attention, especially in the context of the analysis of AIDS incubation time. The chapter discusses nonparametric estimation of the distribution of the survival time of interest by considering the situation where no truncation exists and the situation with truncation on observations on the occurrence of subsequent events. Several algorithms are described and compared for the nonparametric estimation. The chapter deals with regression analysis of doubly interval-censored failure-time data by discussing two methods for fitting the proportional hazards model to the data. The problem of nonparametric comparison of survival functions based on doubly interval-censored failure-time data is considered and some discussion and directions for future researches are mentioned.},

Using the idea of self-consistency, a simple algorithm is constructed and shown to converge monotonically to yield a maximum likelihood estimate of F. An application to hypothesis testing is indicated.}
