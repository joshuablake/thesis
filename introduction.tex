\section{Backcalculation}

\emph{Backcalculation} is the procedure for estimating incidence based on a measurement of prevalence.
\Textcite{brookmeyerMethod} developed it in the context of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
HIV is transmitted sexually or through blood and causes the disease AIDS.
It has killed 40 million people, peaking at 2 million annual deaths~\autocite{unaids2023}.
In this context, backcalculation estimates the incidence of HIV infection from: data on the number of AIDS diagnoses, and the incubation distribution (the time between infection and AIDS diagnosis)~\autocites{brookmeyerBackcalculation}{brookmeyerMeasuring}.
\todo{maybe move some of this to intro}
AIDS is incurable, therefore, AIDS prevalence is equivalent to cumulative incidence.


The original formulations of backcalculation neglected the observation process.
AIDS is almost always diagnosed and recorded in developed countries.
That is, the observations of AIDS diagnoses are the same as the true incidence of AIDS.
An exception is that the reporting delay may be important~\autocite{paganoHIV}.
Reporting delay is not relevant to the studies in this thesis, and I ignore it in this and further discussion.
Therefore, two processes needed to be considered in the context of HIV/AIDS: infection and prevalence.

For SARS-CoV-2, measurements of prevalence are noisy because they are based on population sampling.
The sampling is described as the observation process.
The observation process noise is much larger than the noise of the prevalence process (see \cref{inc-prev:sec:observation-process}).
Therefore, the latter is negligible and again two processes need to be considered: infection and observation.

\section{Durations} \label{inc-prev:sec:duration}

Two approaches are commonly used to estimate durations: either modelling an underlying biomarker or modelling the duration directly~\autocite{sweetingEstimating}.
For SARS-CoV-2, both approaches would be based on the results of PCR testing.
Modelling a biomarker would mean modelling the viral load, measured as a Ct value (see \cref{E-ATACCC}).
Modelling the duration would consider only the binary result at each test (positive or negative); in this thesis a \emph{survival analysis} framework is adopted (see \cref{E-perf-test,E-imperf-test}).
% Survival analysis is the area of statistics concerned with estimating the distribution of the times between two events.
Other related approaches, such as a multi-state model~\autocite{jacksonMSM}, could also be considered (multi-state models can be viewed as a generalisation of survival analysis).
Therefore, the biomarker approach considers more information per observation, however, a model for the biomarker is required which generally requires stronger assumptions.
Modelling a biomarker uses more information per observation, but requires stronger assumptions.
